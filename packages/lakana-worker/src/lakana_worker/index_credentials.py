"""The credential of a registered package index, on its way into `uv sync`.

**The invariant, which the tests pin:** a credential is offered only to the host (and port)
of the registered index's URL, whatever the project's files say; it is never in the project's
directory, never in the environment or the files of the task's own process, and never in a
log line or an error.

How: the worker defines each index itself in the build's `UV_INDEX` variable, with the
credential percent-encoded inside the URL (``name=https://user:password@host/path``). uv keeps
such a credential by scheme, host and port and sends it to nothing else, whatever
`pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` say. The two alternatives fail the invariant against the uv this
was probed with (0.12): a `.netrc` matches the host without the port, and uv's per-index
variables (`UV_INDEX_<NAME>_PASSWORD`) follow the index *name*, which a project can point at
another host.

`resolve_index_access` is the third place that decrypts a secret, after `StorageResolver`
and `lakana_worker.deploy.resolve_credential`.
