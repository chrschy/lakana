"""Fetch one small JSON document over https, from a public address only.

For the discovery documents and key sets of CI OIDC issuers (`lakana_core.ci_oidc.jwks`). A
discovery document names the URL of the keys, so that URL is hostile input even when the issuer
is trusted: the caller names the hosts a request may reach, and everything else is refused.

- `check` requires ``https``, port 443 and an allowed host name (never an IP literal), resolves
  the name **once** under `RESOLVE_TIMEOUT`, and refuses it when **any** of its addresses is
  internal. A host the operator listed (`private_hosts`) may resolve to a private address, so
  that an issuer on an internal network can be reached; loopback, link-local and the known
  metadata addresses stay refused even then (`lakana_core.net.egress.is_never_reachable`).
- `fetch_target` connects to a checked address, not to the name, with the name as the TLS server
  name, so the certificate is verified against the name and DNS cannot answer differently
  between the check and the connection. An operator's proxy resolves the name itself and is
  trusted to refuse internal addresses.
- No redirect is followed, no environment variable is read (``trust_env=False``), the answer
  must be 200, unencoded and at most `MAX_BYTES`, and one deadline covers the whole request.
- Every failure is a `FetchFailed` with a fixed reason, raised outside any ``except`` block.

Call it from a thread without a running event loop.
