"""Iceberg metadata construction, serialisation and update application.

This module is the half of the catalog that has no database. It knows about
pyiceberg and object storage and nothing else, so it can be tested with a temp
directory and no session. It is also the boundary where third-party exception
vocabularies — pyiceberg's and, transitively, pydantic's, which pyiceberg
itself wraps when a stored document fails its schema — become Lakana's own:
`lakana-server` cannot rely on being able to name every third-party exception
type (it must not import pyiceberg at all, per architecture Constraint 2), so
nothing from either vocabulary may reach it untranslated.

    ----------

        The table's schema.

        The table's root location.

    table_uuid
        The table's id. `create_table` generates this id before computing
        `location` (the location is suffixed with its hex
        digits), so it is passed in here rather than letting pyiceberg

        such id to thread through (`test_metadata.py`).
