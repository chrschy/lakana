"""Revoking grants and policies whose target has been dropped.

`Grant`, `RowFilter`, and `ColumnMask` bind to a securable's id, not its
name (`lakana_core.catalog.identity`) — but an id-bound row still keeps
applying forever unless something revokes it when its target goes away.
Without this, a target re-created under the same name can inherit its
predecessor's access, and the two securable kinds get there differently. A
re-created *table* gets a fresh id, so a stale grant's `table_id` never
matches it again — the authorization decision alone already fails closed.
A re-created *namespace* has no id binding at all (`Grant` has no
`namespace_id`; a NAMESPACE-kind grant matches on `environment_id` plus the
literal namespace string, per the design doc's "namespaces cannot be
renamed, so their paths are stable"), so a stale grant matches the new
namespace exactly as it matched the old one — nothing here fails closed on
its own. Either way, the stale row never stops looking "active"
(`revoked_at` stays `None`), so an admin listing by name
(`GrantService.list_for_securable`, `RowFilterService`/
`ColumnMaskService.list_for_table`) keeps showing it long after its target
is gone. `revoke_attached` is the one place `CatalogService.drop_table`,
`drop_namespace`, and `delete_environment` go to close both gaps, each
called after its own authorization and existence checks but before the
drop itself, in the same transaction as the drop's own commit.

    """Soft-revoke every active grant, row filter, and column mask attached to one dropped target.

    Exactly one of `environment_id`, `table_id`, or `namespace` identifies
    the dropped object; which one selects what gets revoked:

    - `environment_id` revokes every active `Grant`, `RowFilter`, and
      `ColumnMask` with that `environment_id` — every grant kind bound to
      the environment, plus every table-scoped policy in it.
    - `table_id` revokes every active `Grant`, `RowFilter`, and
      `ColumnMask` with that `table_id`.
    - `namespace` revokes every active NAMESPACE-kind `Grant` with the
      given `environment_id` and exactly the given namespace path.
      `RowFilter` and `ColumnMask` are always table-scoped, so neither has
      a namespace-kind row to revoke here; nested namespaces need no
      separate call because the caller (`CatalogService.drop_namespace`)
      already refuses to drop a namespace that still contains one.

    Each revoked row gets `revoked_at` set to now and `revoked_by` set to
    `actor.id`, plus one audit event (`GRANT_REVOKED`, `ROW_FILTER_REVOKED`,
    or `COLUMN_MASK_REVOKED`) with `detail={"reason": "target_dropped",
    "id": str(row.id)}`. Nothing here commits; the caller's own subsequent
    commit persists the revocations atomically alongside the drop itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    session
        Database session.
    actor
        The principal performing the drop; recorded as `revoked_by` and as
        the audit events' `principal_id`. `None` for a drop by the system (an expiry), which
        records no principal.
    environment_id
        The dropped environment's id, if that is the target.
    table_id
        The dropped table's id, if that is the target.
    namespace
        `(environment_id, joined_path)` for the dropped namespace, if that
        is the target. `joined_path` is `NamespacePath.joined()`'s
        unit-separator-joined storage form, matching `Grant.namespace`.
    now
        The time to stamp `revoked_at` with; the Python clock when `None`. `drop_table`
        passes its drop time, so an undrop can tell a row still as the drop left it.

    Returns
    -------
    list of RevokedPolicy
        Every row revoked, across all three models.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If zero or more than one of `environment_id`/`table_id`/`namespace`
        is given — a programming error in the caller, not a condition a
        real drop can trigger. A plain `raise`, not an `assert`: under
        `python -O`, an `assert` here would be stripped, and a no-target
        call would fall through to `bound.table_id == None`, which
        SQLAlchemy renders as `IS NULL` and so would mass-revoke every row
        of every kind that has no `table_id` at all (every `ENVIRONMENT`-
        and `NAMESPACE`-kind `Grant`) instead of doing nothing.
