"""The artifact sweep: remove what a crash or an abandoned upload left behind.

Run in a thread of its own by the worker that holds the scheduler role. It deletes bytes
unattended, so the one rule is: **bytes that a live version or an upload in progress still names
are never deleted, and the database never says a file is stored when its bytes are gone.** A file
that has no `artifact_blobs` row is a different matter, because a database restored from an
older backup, a failover that lost recent commits, or a fresh database pointed at an existing
bucket leaves storage that the catalog has forgotten. Such a file is deleted only after
`ORPHAN_BLOB_GRACE` or when a deleted version's manifest names it, and never while a manifest
object the catalog does not know, a live version's manifest or an unexpired upload's manifest
names it; a manifest object of an unknown version and a directory without a row and marker are
never deleted. When in doubt, the sweep leaves a thing alone.

What it removes, for an artifact that has a catalog row, each decision under the artifact's lock
(`lock_artifact`) and with the one ``now`` the run was given:

1. upload rows that have expired;
2. `artifact_blobs` rows whose hash no live version, no unexpired upload and no manifest object
   the database does not know names, and then, one file at a time, their bytes (rows first,
   bytes second, as `ArtifactService._retire` and `_release` do);
3. objects under ``blobs/`` that have no row, **and have a reason to go**: the hash is named by
   the manifest of a *deleted* version of this artifact (a release that was cut short), or the
   object is older than `ORPHAN_BLOB_GRACE` (a file stored by an upload that never committed and
   expired), and no live version and no unexpired upload names it, whatever its record says (one
   check per batch of such files; the files kept are counted in `named_files_kept` and logged
   once per artifact). An object with no modification time is left alone. `BlobUpload.finish`
   makes an object visible and inserts its row under the lock, so an object without a row that is
   seen *under the lock* is not a file being stored; seen outside it, it may be. The sweep lists
   without a lock, checks rows for a batch of names in one query, and only then takes the lock
   for each candidate, reads the row again, deletes that one object and lets the lock go;
4. temporary ``.part`` objects older than the upload lifetime (never less than an hour): an
   upload in progress writes them, so only age makes one garbage (a file's modification time is
   its last write, which is never before its upload began, so an old one belongs to an expired
   upload). Only the local backend has them: on S3 the writer uploads in parts to the final key,
   and an incomplete multipart upload is invisible to a listing, so the bucket needs a lifecycle
   rule that aborts incomplete multipart uploads;
5. ``manifests/<n>.json`` objects of a version whose row has ``deleted_at`` set (a release that
   failed or was cut short by its budget). The database row decides, never the object. An object
   whose number is *greater than the highest version the database knows* is never deleted: it
   is a commit in flight (a commit writes it inside its transaction, under the artifact's lock,
   before the row is committed, and the sweep decides under that same lock), a failed commit's
   leftover (a number storage has seen is never reused, so the next commit takes a
   higher one and the object stays), or a version the database lost. Its
   files are protected too: before the sweep removes a row or an object of an artifact it reads
   those manifest objects (at most `MAX_UNKNOWN_MANIFESTS`, each at most 16 MiB) and treats every
   hash they name as referenced; more of them, or one that cannot be read, leaves the artifact
   alone for this run. An object at or below the highest known number with no version row at all
   is left alone too: a crashed commit followed by a successful one leaves exactly that.

Anything else under an artifact's directory is left alone and counted.

A prefix ``artifacts/<id>/`` whose id has no catalog row is removed only if it carries the marker
`ArtifactService.drop_artifact` writes first (``.dropped``, under the artifact's lock, before the
row is deleted) and deletes last, so an interrupted removal is resumed. The id is a random UUID
that is never reused, and a new artifact's row is created before its first object is written, so a
marked prefix without a row is a dropped artifact's; each object is still deleted only after a
lock on the id found no row. A rowless prefix without a marker is left alone, counted
(`unmarked_prefixes`) and reported once per environment and run: it may be an artifact a restored
database forgot. A marker next to an existing row (a drop whose commit failed) is left in place
and ignored; the next drop of that artifact overwrites it. Ids are read strictly (32 lower-case
hex digits, a directory); anything under ``artifacts/`` that does not parse is left alone and
counted, and the sweep never deletes outside ``artifacts/<id>/``. The storage layer refuses to
create a table inside the root's ``artifacts/`` directory, so no table's data can be taken for
an artifact's.

A manifest of a live version or open upload that cannot be read may name any file. For that
artifact the sweep deletes nothing (no row, no object, no manifest object), counts it, and
logs one line with the artifact's name.

Bounds. The sweep runs off the scheduler's thread: a hung object-store call or a wait for an
artifact's lock stalls nothing but itself. One run has a deadline (`max_seconds`) shared between
the environments (each gets the time that is left divided by the environments not yet visited,
and the starting environment and artifact rotate from run to run), and ends at the next decision
once it is past it or once `should_stop` says so (shutdown). The next run starts again, from the
next artifact in the rotation; since what was deleted does not come back, a run that did some
work leaves less for the next one. It does not resume inside an artifact: see the last known
limit below. Prefixes without a row get half of an
environment's time. A storage or database error for one artifact is logged and counted and the
others go on; after `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` in a row the environment is given up for this
run. Listings are iterated, never collected: `Storage.list_objects` for one artifact at a time,
`Storage.list_children` one level of ``artifacts/``. Both ask the backend for current state
(`FsspecStorage` drops fsspec's directory cache for the listed path first, and a listing that
is stale anyway can only name objects already gone or miss new ones, because every delete is
decided again against the database under the lock).

Known limits:

- A storage delete in flight can outlive the artifact lock when the server ends the database
  session (a timeout or a failover) during a slow delete.
- Each run starts an artifact's row pass from its beginning, and the run's time share per
  artifact is fixed, so an artifact whose row pass does not fit it (roughly 200,000 distinct
  files in one artifact) never reaches its later rows or its object pass, however often the
  sweep runs. Rotating the starting artifact makes the others fair, not this one finish.

    Parameters
    ----------
    session
        Database session; the sweep commits its own transactions on it and leaves it without
        one open.
    storage
        Resolves each environment's storage.
    now
        The sweep's time (the database's clock in production), used for the whole run.
    upload_ttl_seconds
        `LAKANA_ARTIFACTS__UPLOAD_TTL_SECONDS`: how long a temporary file may sit unwritten.
    max_seconds
        How long the run may take, shared between the environments, before it stops at the
        next decision.
    monotonic
        The clock the deadline is read from; `time.monotonic` when `None`.
    rotation
        A number that grows by one with each run of the same process; it moves the starting
        environment and artifact so that no one's backlog always comes first.
    should_stop
        Called before every decision; the run ends when it returns `True` (shutdown).

    Returns
    -------
    SweepReport
        What was removed. An artifact that failed, or whose manifest is damaged, is counted and
        skipped; an environment whose storage cannot be reached is counted and skipped; the
        others are still swept.
