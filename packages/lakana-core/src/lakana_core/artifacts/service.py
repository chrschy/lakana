"""The artifact service: adding a version, reading versions, downloading files.

An artifact is a row of `tables` with `table_type = ARTIFACT` and versions
that are never edited. `ArtifactService` owns every operation on it. Like
`CatalogService`, every method commits internally.

Every method authorizes on the table-scope securable of the name before it
looks anything up: a caller who may not use the name gets the
authorization error a table of that name would give, and learns nothing about
whether the artifact, a version, a file or an upload exists. Every
`NotFoundError`, `ValidationError` and `ConflictError` below is raised only
after authorization has passed.

A version is added in three steps. `begin_upload` validates the manifest,
creates the artifact on first use and records an open upload; `receive_blob`
streams each missing file to storage while hashing it; `commit_upload` turns
the complete upload into the next version in one transaction. The artifact's
lock (`lock_artifact`) is taken before any read a decision depends on
and held to the end of the transaction. A file becomes visible, and gets its
`artifact_blobs` row, under that lock. The protected-write guard
runs at `begin_upload` and at `commit_upload`; at the commit its
`record_pending` runs inside the locked transaction, so a task attempt that
was reclaimed or cancelled in between is refused with no version written.

Nothing derived from a request reaches a storage path except `blob_path`
(which accepts only 64 lower-case hex digits) and `manifest_path` (which takes
a number the service chose). A request's manifest passes `parse_manifest`
before any use, and no message echoes a manifest path except through `shown`.

An artifact has at most `MAX_OPEN_UPLOADS` open uploads. `begin_upload`, under the
artifact's lock, deletes the expired ones and, for a task attempt, the unfinished ones of
its own task run with its claim or a lower one (a dead attempt's), and refuses
while the limit is reached. A blob request reads one
file's size from the stored manifest with `manifest_size`; only `begin_upload`,
`get_version` and `commit_upload` validate a whole manifest.

`abort_upload` withdraws the caller's own unfinished upload: it authorizes `WRITE_TABLE`, takes
the lock, deletes the row and leaves every file to the sweep; it calls no guard.

`delete_version` and `drop_artifact` authorize `DROP_TABLE` first and refuse any principal
with a task scope or a run context, bound or not. Pruning by `keep_versions` is part of a task's
own commit: it needs neither, and takes its number only from the bound token.

The database changes first, under the artifact's lock: the version is marked, and the
`artifact_blobs` rows of files no live version and no unexpired upload names are removed,
the set built from a stream of manifests with the transaction's own `now`. If any manifest
that could name a file cannot be read, no file is freed (the audit event says why). Bytes are
removed afterwards, one file at a time under the lock again and only while that file still
has no row, so a row never outlives its bytes; bytes that outlive their rows are garbage for
the sweep, and a storage failure is logged and never reaches the caller.

Known limits, for the documentation:

- A delete request that timed out at the client can still reach the object store after the
  artifact's lock is released.
- After a failed storage removal a deleted version's files and its `manifests/<n>.json` (file
  names and hashes) stay until the sweep or a drop removes them.
- The storage delete in flight can also outlive the lock when the server ends the database
  session (a timeout or a failover) during a slow delete.
- A release runs one short transaction and one storage delete per file inside the request, and
  stops after `RELEASE_BUDGET_FILES` files or `RELEASE_BUDGET_SECONDS` seconds. The files left,
  and the manifest object of a version whose release was cut short, stay in storage, with no
  `artifact_blobs` row and no live version, until the next sweep removes them; the deleted
  version is gone for every reader at once, because that is a database change.
- The audit event's `freed_files` counts files made eligible for removal, not objects removed;
  the delete's own answer (`DeletedVersionView`) counts the files this request removed and says
  which it left to the sweep.
- A drop leaves the empty `blobs` and `manifests` directories of a local backend; the storage
  interface has no way to remove a directory.
- A damaged manifest keeps its artifact's files in storage, with their rows, until the damaged
  version is deleted and the sweep runs.
- The audit lookup that keeps `ARTIFACT_DOWNLOADED` to one event per principal and
  version has no index of its own; it uses the existing audit indexes.
- `list_artifacts` returns every artifact the caller may read, without paging. `list_versions`
  returns every version, deleted ones included (a deleted version keeps its row for ever), in a
  fixed number of statements and without their manifests, but still without paging.
- A commit's pruning (`_prune`) loads every live version of the artifact with its manifest, to
  decide which files stay; an artifact with very many large live versions makes a commit slow.
  Bound it with `keep_versions`.
- The artifact sweep does not resume inside an artifact: each run starts an artifact's row pass
  again, so an artifact with roughly 200,000 distinct files never gets past it (see the sweep's
  known limits).
- `delete_environment` locks the environment row after its checks, a deadlock shape
  that table writes share.
- An upload can be withdrawn only by its owner and only by its id (`abort_upload`); a person
  whose process was killed without a trace of the id leaves it open, and 16 such uploads block
  an artifact until they expire. Nothing lists a person's open uploads.
- A blob row whose bytes were lost from storage is not detected until a download
  fails with "missing from storage"; `begin_upload` trusts the row.
