"""On Postgres: what the unit tier cannot show about the cap on a principal's queries.

SQLite has one writer, so the unit tests can only show that the start update carries the cap.
Here two real connections claim runs of one principal at the same moment: the advisory lock
makes the second wait for the first, and the second then counts the first's run. No worker runs
in this module: the tests call `poller._next_query` and `pipeline._start` themselves. Every
wait has a bound.
