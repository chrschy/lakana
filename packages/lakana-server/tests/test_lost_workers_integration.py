"""On Postgres: what the unit tier cannot show about the write fence.

SQLite has no row locks, so the unit tests can only show that the fence's `WHERE` clause
refuses. Here a worker thread runs a real write on real Postgres and SeaweedFS and is held
at the fence, before or after `ProtectedWriteGuard.record_pending`, while the test ends the
run or tries to. Every wait has a bound.
