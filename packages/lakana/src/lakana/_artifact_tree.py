"""Writing a downloaded artifact to disk, so that the manifest alone decides what is written.

The manifest comes over the network, and a compromised or buggy server, or a manifest stored
before a rule existed, may send anything. Nothing is trusted:

- every path is checked again with this package's own copy of the path rules before the first
  byte is written, and the whole download is refused if one fails (`check_manifest`);
- the tree is written into a fresh staging directory, never into the target's own files, and
  moved into place only once every file is complete and verified. The target is never replaced
  when it already exists (a person's shell may stand in it, it may be a mount point, it keeps
  its mode):

  * a target that does not exist is staged in a sibling directory
    (``.<name>.lakana-partial-<random>``) and that directory is renamed to the target in one
    step. A failed download leaves nothing at the target; a killed process leaves the staging
    directory, under a name that says it is unfinished, and the target does not exist;
  * a target that exists and is empty is staged in a directory of the same name *inside* it,
    and the finished tree's top-level entries are then moved into the target one by one, by
    descriptor, before the empty staging directory is removed. A failed download leaves the
    target empty and present. The move is **not atomic**: a process killed while moving leaves
    some entries in the target and the rest in the unfinished staging directory inside it; the
    person empties the target (including that hidden directory) and downloads again;
  * a target that exists and is not an empty directory, or is a link, is refused before
    anything is written;
- the target is opened exactly once, by descriptor: its parent is resolved and opened, and the
  target is opened *relative to the parent's descriptor* with ``O_NOFOLLOW``, so a link put at
  its name at any moment is refused at the open. Whether it is empty is read through that
  descriptor, and the staging directory and the moves use it, never the target's path, so a
  path swapped for a link while the download runs redirects nothing;
- no link is followed. Where the platform allows (Linux, macOS) directories and files are
  created relative to a directory descriptor, with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` on every component and
  ``O_EXCL`` on every new file, so a link that is already there, or put there while the download
  runs, cannot redirect a write: a swapped directory ends as a refusal naming the file, and
  descriptors keep a write inside the directory that was opened. Where it does not (Windows)
  files are written by path below an anchor resolved once, at the start; each directory is
  checked to lie inside it before anything is created below it, and the staging directory's
  device and inode, taken when it was made, are compared before each file and before the final
  step. A directory swapped for a link between a check and the write is not noticed there, and
  neither is a target swapped, during setup, for a link to an *empty* directory: the emptiness
  check passes on the other directory and the tree is built there;
- every file is written to a temporary name and renamed to its own name only after its size and
  SHA-256 equal the manifest's, so a file with its real name in the tree is always a verified one;
- permissions: a person's copy is private (files 0600 and directories 0700, less the umask,
  never executable), because the contents are access-controlled on the server and a
  world-readable copy on a shared machine would leak them. With ``read_only`` (a task's inputs)
  files are 0400 and directories 0500, sealed through descriptors, deepest first, before the
  tree is moved into place; when the target already existed it keeps its own mode, and its
  top-level directories are sealed right after they were moved, because Linux refuses to move
  a directory that cannot be written to into another directory. The staging directory is 0700
  while it is written;
- a failure of the file system (a name it refuses, a full disk, a permission) ends as a
  `ManifestError` that names the path and the system's reason, never as a raw `OSError`.
