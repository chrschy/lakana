    """Download a version of artifact NAME (namespace.name) into DIRECTORY.

    DIRECTORY must not exist, or be empty. The files appear there only when all of them have
    arrived and match the manifest; if anything goes wrong nothing is left at DIRECTORY (a
    directory that did not exist is not there, one that existed is empty again) and the message
    says what to do. An empty directory is never replaced: it keeps its place and its mode, and
    the files are moved into it at the end. Nothing is written through a link.

    The copy is private to you, because the artifact's contents are access-controlled on the
    server: files are 0600 and directories 0700 (less your umask), nothing is executable. To open
    the copy to others run `chmod -R a+rX DIR`. (A read-only copy, files 0400 and directories
    0500, is what a task gets as its input; remove one with `chmod -R u+w DIR` first.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    ctx
        The Typer context.
    name
        The qualified artifact name, such as `models.churn`.
    directory
        Where to write: a new or an empty directory.
    version
        The version number; the current version by default.
    env
        The environment.
