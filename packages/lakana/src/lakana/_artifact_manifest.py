"""The SDK's copy of the artifact manifest's path rules and canonical form.

`lakana_core.artifacts.manifest` holds the server's rules; the SDK imports
nothing of core, so the same functions live here. They must judge every path
and hash every manifest alike:
`packages/lakana-worker/tests/test_artifact_manifest_parity.py` runs both on
the same inputs. Change one copy, change the other.

The character classes, case folding and normalisation used here come from the
Unicode tables of the Python that runs them. An SDK and a server on different
Python versions can therefore disagree about a newly assigned character. The
server's answer is the one that counts; a disagreement ends as a refused
upload, never as a path that is stored unchecked.
