# Delete an artifact version

After this guide you can remove one version of an artifact, or the whole artifact, and you know
what that removes and what it does not. Lakana cannot undo a deletion: the files are removed from
storage. If your bucket keeps old object versions, a deleted file stays in the bucket until the
bucket's own rule removes it.

You need `DROP_TABLE` on the artifact. The roles `DATA_ENGINEER` and `ADMIN` have it. A task token
never has it: a running task cannot delete anything, whatever its principal may do.

If you only want to keep fewer versions over time, set `keep_versions` instead:
[Limit how many versions are kept](limit-artifact-versions.md).

## Delete one version

**1. Find the number.** The `artifact versions list` subcommand of `lakana`, with the artifact's
name, shows the versions, newest first. Note the number of the one to delete. Numbers can have
gaps.

**2. Delete it.** Give the name and the version number. The example removes version 3 of
`models.scratch_model`, a test artifact made only for this page: it has three versions, which
`artifact upload` stored one after the other (see [`upload`](../reference/artifacts.md#upload)).
Put the name of **your** artifact there. `--yes` skips the question, so check the name before you
press Enter:

<!-- source: docs/examples/train-and-predict/run.sh#delete-version -->
```bash
lakana artifact versions delete models.scratch_model 3 --env dev --yes
```

Without `--yes` the command first asks, naming what it will remove: `Delete version 3 of
dev/models.scratch_model (33 B, 1 file)? Its bytes are removed from Lakana's storage. Lakana cannot
bring them back. [y/N]: ` Answer `y` to go on; any other answer, or just Enter, stops. Without a
terminal, for example in a script, it refuses and says `Refusing without a terminal; pass --yes to
confirm.` Add `--yes` only when you are sure.

The command prints what it did. Version 3 had one file that no other version shares, so the file
is freed:

<!-- output -->
```text
Deleted version 3 of dev/models.scratch_model. Freed 1 file (33 B).
```

## What the answer says

The command tells you how many files and bytes it freed from Lakana's storage, and, when a file
stayed, how many and why. In this example version 1 and version 2 of `models.scratch_twin` hold
the same file, so deleting version 1 frees nothing: version 2 still needs the file.

<!-- source: docs/examples/train-and-predict/run.sh#delete-shared -->
```bash
lakana artifact versions delete models.scratch_twin 1 --env dev --yes
```

<!-- output -->
```text
Deleted version 1 of dev/models.scratch_twin. Freed no files.
Kept 1 file (33 B) that version 2 also uses.
```

A file stays for one of three reasons:

| The answer says | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `that version 2 also uses` (or `that another version also uses`) | A version that is not deleted has the same file. Lakana names the version only when you may read the artifact. | Nothing. Delete that version too to free the file. |
| `that an open upload names` | Someone began an upload that lists the file and has not finished it. | Wait until it is committed, withdrawn or has expired (one hour by default). The person who began it can withdraw it: [List and withdraw an open upload](withdraw-an-artifact-upload.md). |
| `that Lakana's periodic clean-up decides about: it removes what nothing else needs and keeps the rest` | This request did not remove the file: a large version (the request removes up to 200 files or 5 seconds' worth), a storage error, a manifest the catalog does not know after a restore, a damaged manifest, or a file stored again while the delete ran. | Nothing: the clean-up removes the file if no version and no open upload needs it, and keeps it if one does, so it may stay for good. Ask the operator if it stays and you expect it gone. |

A file that two paths of one version share counts once. With `--output json` the answer has the
same numbers: `freed_files`, `freed_bytes`, `kept_files`, `kept_bytes` and `kept`, a list of
`reason`, `files`, `bytes` and `version`. In the SDK `delete_version` returns them on the version
it gives back, see the [reference](../reference/artifacts.md#sdk).

## What deleting a version means

- **The files are removed from storage**, except a file that another live version of the same
  artifact still has, or an open upload names, or that the clean-up decides about ("What the
  answer says"). Lakana cannot bring them back. If your bucket keeps old object versions, a
  deleted file stays there until the bucket's own rule removes it.
- **The record stays.** `artifact versions list` still shows the version, marked deleted, with who
  deleted it and when. Its number is never used again. The lineage that names it stays.
- **If you delete the newest version, the one before it becomes current.** Assets that read the
  current version then read the older one. This is how you roll back a bad model.
- **Copies are not recalled.** A copy that someone downloaded stays on their machine, and a backup
  of your storage still holds the file.
- The names and hashes of its files stay in the catalog, with the record. The contents do not.

## In a protected environment

A protected environment accepts changes only from runs of the deployed code. To delete a version
there you need `MANAGE_ENVIRONMENT` as well as `DROP_TABLE`, and a reason of 10 to 500
characters on one line. Put your own artifact's name, version and environment in the example: it
removes version 3 of `models.scratch_model` in `prod`, and the `--reason` text goes into the
audit log:

<!-- not tested: destructive; covered by the CLI and integration tests -->
```bash
lakana artifact versions delete models.scratch_model 3 --env prod --break-glass --reason "Model 3 was trained on the wrong customers"
```

The command warns that the write is audited. Without the two options the server refuses:
``Environment 'prod' is protected: only runs of the deployed project version may write. See `lakana run`.``
`--break-glass` without `--reason` is a usage error, and so is `--reason` alone.

## Drop the whole artifact

Dropping removes every version with its files, and the artifact's grants. The example drops
`models.scratch_model`, the test artifact from above, whose version 3 is already deleted. Put the
name of **your** artifact there. `--yes` skips the question, so check the name before you press
Enter:

<!-- source: docs/examples/train-and-predict/run.sh#drop -->
```bash
lakana artifact drop models.scratch_model --env dev --yes
```

Without `--yes` the command asks first, and without a terminal it refuses, as for a version. In
the example, version 3 was deleted before, so the question is `Drop artifact
dev/models.scratch_model and delete its 2 versions (66 B, 1 more already deleted)? This cannot be
undone. [y/N]: `
The command prints:

<!-- output -->
```text
Dropped artifact dev/models.scratch_model; its files are removed from storage, and Lakana's periodic clean-up removes any it could not.
```

- The name becomes free. If you create an artifact of that name again, it starts at version 1 as a
  new artifact. Grants given on the old artifact itself are gone; grants on its namespace still apply.
- The drop includes versions that were stored after you were asked to confirm.
- **If the asset that produces it is still deployed, its next run creates the artifact again**,
  owned by the run's principal, at version 1. To stop that, remove or change the asset and deploy.
- A table is not dropped with this command. For a table, use the `table delete` subcommand.
- The server removes the files inside the request, so a very large artifact can take minutes. A
  reverse proxy in front of the server must allow a request that long, or you see a 504 for a drop
  that still finishes. Check with the `artifact list` subcommand before you run it again.

## When it fails

| You see | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| A permission error (exit code 5) | You lack `DROP_TABLE` on the artifact, or the artifact does not exist. The answer is the same on purpose. | Check the name, then ask for the permission. |
| `A task token cannot delete a version or drop an artifact, and neither can a running task or query. ...` | A task or a task token tried to delete. | Delete as a person or a service account, or set `keep_versions` on the asset. |
| `Version 3 of dev/models.scratch_model was already deleted (<time>). Run ... to see the others.` | Someone did it already. | List the versions. |
| `models.scratch_model has no version 9.` | No version has that number. | List the versions. |
| `Environment 'prod' is protected: ...` | The environment is protected. | Use `--break-glass --reason`, or deploy a change instead. |
| `The server did not answer the request to delete version 3 of dev/models.scratch_model (...), so the version may or may not have been deleted. ...` | The answer was lost. | List the versions. If the version is not marked deleted, run the delete again. |
| `The server did not answer the request to drop dev/models.scratch_model (...), so it may or may not be dropped; if the server is still working, it finishes by itself. ...` | The drop takes longer than the connection. | Run the `artifact list` subcommand. If the artifact is still listed after a while, run the drop again. |
| `models.scratch_model is a table, not an artifact. ...` | The name belongs to a table. | Use the `table delete` subcommand. |

Every option is in the [reference](../reference/artifacts.md).
